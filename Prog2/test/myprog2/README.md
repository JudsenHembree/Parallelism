This is an optimization project from my paralellism course. 
- We use Cuda to multiply matrixes in this project. 
- There are various optimizations versions. 
- The version with all the optimizatoins included is the regular mmOpt.cu.
- A writeup on my experience with this project is at Parallelsim/Prog2/test/Writup.pdf.

Thanks!
