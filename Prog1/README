This is a project from my parallelsim course. It contains both an ispc and pthread solution to the mandelbrot set and a pthread saxpy computation. There is a writeup detailing my experience with the project at Parallelism/Prog1/prog1/Writeup.odt.
Code for mandelbrot and saxpy at Parallelsim/Prog1/prog1/prog1

Sorry for the bad prog1/prog1/prog1 stuff. New to git not changing it at this moment.
